# OOP implementation in Rust

### Goals
- Create structs as different modules for practicing packaging and trait usage
- Interactive Command-Line UI for a game-like experience
- Learn about how video games simulate levels, bots? is it random? (hard-coded levels)? Smart agent simulations

### Game-flow: TIME-BASED
Game Time: 5 minutes

Uses: Simulating *Finite-state Customers*
- Customers have wait-times {anger levels --> for giving tips and leaving restaurant}
- Customers have {nice} values --> determines tip size 
- Customers have 3 types of order: burger, hotdog, drink --> permutation of 3 without repetition

Player tasks:
- Operating a Grill: placing hotdogs and steaks
- Serving different customers food
- Taking Tips left by customers for new customers to take their spot
